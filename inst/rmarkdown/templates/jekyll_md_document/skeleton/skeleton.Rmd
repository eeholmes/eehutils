This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents for a jeykll-created website on GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for uploading to your jekyll-created website is created.  

It will have GitHub flavored markdown and a jekyll flavored yaml.
